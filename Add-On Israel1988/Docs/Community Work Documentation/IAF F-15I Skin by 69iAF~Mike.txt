F-15I IAF skin texture for the Open Falcon F-15E model. by 69iAF~Mike
---------------------------------------------------
The texture uses some original OF textures, mainly on small parts and the lower fuselage. 
(If any other credit-dependant artist has a hand in some of these textures- let me know)

Included are two folders: 
One with the DXT1 compressed skin and the other is compressed by DXT3.
DXT3 is better quality-wise. 

INSTALL AT YOUR OWN RISK.
 I do not include instructions nor do I hold any responsibility for any damage you might cause to anything by installing this skin. 
Not that it could harm something, just don't install it if you don't know how to. YOU might break something :)

Big thanks to efi69 (well heck , I don't know you by any other name) for all the beta testing and starting me on this in the first place.

This skin is released first for WWW.PREFLIGHT.US
