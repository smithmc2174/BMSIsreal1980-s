F-16 Pilot Model for BMS 4.32

Apart from model files I also included the LOD Editor and photoshop file 
for 8019 texture for those that want their own pages on kneepad and the LOD file with only the model if you want to use it on other AC.


Installation guide:


1. !!!Create a backup of files (not folders) in: <dir>\Falcon BMS\Data\Terrdata\objects\!!!
2. Put 8018.dds and 8019.dds files in <dir>\BMS\Data\Terrdata\objects\KoreaObj\
3. Open LOD Editor
4. Click on 'normal', then '1' under "Edit"
8. Click on 'Select LOD'
9. Select LOD no. 82
10. Select Action>Append/replace texture
11. Select 8018.dds and 8019.dds
12. Click on 'Action'>replace model
13. Choose 'loaded.lod' from the archive.
14. When the LE changes appearence you can close it down.
15. Enjoy your new body!
